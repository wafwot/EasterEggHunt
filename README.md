EasterEggHunt
=============

Spigot (and bukkit) plugin for Easter Egg Hunts


Whenever I push something from Eclipse it erases everything in the root. Is there any way to 
use the eclipse IDE and github in a decent way? Or is it always kinda a hack job? This
readme file will be erased whenever I push from Eclipse. And when using github from the IDE it
will never let anything in the root of a depo. Weird.

Anyone know how to actually set this up to work right? From the Eclipse IDE, idgaf if you know
a different IDE or command line that works. I can get it working great from Linux command line too.
